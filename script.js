// Algorithms notes

to use RAM, memory, you have to allocate it.

4 gb ram, 4 billion bytes of ram.

int main(void)
{
  string s = get_string("Name: ");
  char initials[4];
  int counter = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++)
  {
    if (isupper[i]))
    {
        initials[i] = name[i];
        counter += 1; 
        // same as counter ++ and counter = counter + 1;
    }
  }
  initials[3]
  printf("%s\n", initals);


// sequence is also known as Array.

computer can only look at one thing at a time.
