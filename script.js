// Algorithms notes

to use RAM, memory, you have to allocate it.

4 gb ram, 4 billion bytes of ram.

int main(void)
{
  string s = get_string("Name: ");
  char initials[4];
  int counter = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++)
  {
    if (isupper[i]))
    {
        initials[i] = name[i];
        counter += 1; 
        // same as counter ++ and counter = counter + 1;
    }
//   }
//   initials[3]
//   printf("%s\n", initals);


// // sequence is also known as Array.

// computer can only look at one thing at a time.

// to find one number.
// integers back to back.

// sorting data can help with algorithms much more efficiently.

// left to right search called: linear search

// exam books at front of class. compare two at a time.

// comparing two at a time results in an extreme value ending up at end of Array.

// selection sort - comparing lowest value to current value.

// bubble sort - repeat until no swaps. pairwise (neighbor) elements.

n-1 refers to end of the list.

running time

n-1 pairs if each pair of elements is counted.

(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1
n(n-1)/2

upper bound running time, O notation
order of n^2 steps 

lower bound algorithm running time omega notation
